CRM and AD Managed Accounts 

Referring to the following article in the TechNet: 
“Managed service accounts (group-managed service accounts (gMSA) 
or single-managed service accounts) and virtual accounts (NT SERVICE\,<SERVICENAME>) 
aren’t supported for running Microsoft Dynamics 365 services.”

The following subsections describe the domain user account permissions 
required for each service or application pool identity:
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sandbox Processing Service
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Asynchronous Processing Service and 
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Asynchronous Processing Service (maintenance) services
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Monitoring Service
Microsoft Dynamics 365 VSS Writer service
Deployment Web Service (CRMDeploymentServiceAppPool AppPoolID)
Application Service (CRMAppPool IIS AppPoolID)

" Logon as service" permission in the Local Security Policy.
service account may need an SPN for the URL used to access the site that is associated with it.

By default, IIS websites are configured to use Kernel-Mode authentication. 
When you run the Microsoft Dynamics 365 website by using Kernel-Mode authentication, 
you might not need to configure additional service principal names (SPNs) 
for the CRMAppPool identities.

If kernel-mode authentication is enabled, the SPNs will be defined for the machine account, 
regardless of the specified service account. When you implement a web farm, 
enable kernel-mode authentication and change the local ApplicationHost.config file.

To determine whether your IIS deployment requires SPNs, see 
Service Principal Name (SPN) checklist for Kerberos authentication with IIS 7.0/7.5.

Dynamics 365 Server Setup creates application pools called 
CRMAppPool and CRMDeploymentServiceAppPool 
that operate under user credentials that you specify during Setup. 

If application and deployment web services are running on the same system, 
and kernel-mode authentication is disabled, you could configure both services 
to run under the same domain user account to prevent duplicate SPN issues
